    <h1>This is a Heading 1</h1>

    <p>
        This is a paragraph describing the way I like to code. I code in the morning, I code in the afternoon, 
        but I like to code more at night. The werewolves don't come at night when I code; my superpower grows, 
        and as Naruto helps me, my code becomes powerful like a lightsaber. Gundam robots come out of my code 
        as I solve the mysteries of algorithms, dungeons, and dragons.
    </p>

    <h2>This is a table with the heading 2</h2>

    <table style="width:100%">
        <tr>
            <th>Course Number</th>
            <th>Course Name</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>CSC 2431</td>
            <td>Data Structures & Algorithms</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>MAT 1720</td>
            <td>Discrete Math</td>
        </tr>
